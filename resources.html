                <label for="faq1" class="faq-question">When should I start baby led weaning?</label>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Most babies are ready from about 6 months. This is when they can usually sit upright independently, have lost their tongue-thrust, show interest in food and have good head control. It is recommended to always consult with your health visitor before starting.</p>
                </div>

                <label for="faq2" class="faq-question">How much should my baby eat?</label>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>In the first few months of BLW, very little food may actually be consumed - don't worry! Remember - "Food before one is just for fun" - breast milk or formula still remains the primary source of nutrition. Let your baby self-regulate. By 12 months, solid foods will gradually become their main source of nutrition.</p>

                <label for="faq3" class="faq-question">What if my baby just plays with food?</label>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>This is completely normal and actually important! Babies will learn through exploration and playing. They need to be able to touch, squish and investigate food to understand it. This sensory exploration helps them become comfortable with different textures and is a crucial part of learning to eat.</p>

                <label for="faq4" class="faq-question">Is BLW safe?</label>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>When done correctly with the appropriate foods and supervision, BLW is safe to practice. Studies show there is no increased risk of choking compared to traditional weaning. They key is understanding the difference between gagging (normal and protective) and choking (severe medical emergency), proper food preparation, and constant supervision</p>

                <label for="faq5" class="faq-question">My baby doesn't have teeth. Can they still do BLW?</label>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Absolutely! Babies have strong gums that can mash soft food effectively. Teeth are not necessary for BLW. Most babies don't get their teeth until about 8-10 months or later. Make sure foods are soft enough to squish between your fingers before giving them to your baby.</p>

                <label for="faq6" class="faq-question">What is my baby gags frequently?</label>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Gagging is a normal and protective reflex that prevents choking. It's actually more common in babies doing BLW, which helps strengthen this protective mechanism. Babies typically gag less as they gain experience. If they do experience a gagging episode, remain calm and let your baby work through it - your calm response teaches them is is okay.</p>

                <label for="faq7" class="faq-question">How do i safely introduce allergens?</label>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Current guidelines recommend introducing allergens early (around the 6 month mark) and often. Make sure to only introduce one new allergen at a time, and in small amounts. Watch for reactions for the next 3-5 days before introducing another. Offer these foods multiple times per week once they've been introduced.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, but go by your baby's adjusted age (due date, not birth date) and developmental readiness. Premature babies sometimes need more time to develop the skills needed for BLW. Always consult your health visitor about timing and approach.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Communicate clearly about BLW principles and safety. Provide written guidelines about appropriate foods, sizes, and supervision. Consider sending pre-prepared foods. Some nurseries require purees - discuss your options with them. You can do BLW at home and purees at nursery.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The key is education and communication. Share research, videos, and resources with them. Take an infant CPR class together. Start slowly with simple, less scary foods. Let concerned family members observe supervised meals. Sometimes having your health visitor explain the approach helps gain support.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Not necessarily! You can share family foods with your baby (just hold the salt), which is more economical than buying special baby food. Batch cooking and freezing portions saves money. While some families buy special BLW products, they're not necessary - simple whole foods work perfectly.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>This can vary. Some babies eat well from the start, others take months to get the hang of it. Most babies gradually increase intake between 8-10 months as their pincer grasp develops and they become more efficient eaters. By 12 months, most are eating significant amounts.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, small amounts of water can be offered with meals from around 6 months. Use an open cup or straw cup rather than sippy cups. Water shouldn't replace breast milk or formula. A few ounces per day is sufficient in the first year.</p>
